            <p className="commitment-description">
              With a Bachelor of Dental Surgery and an MBA in Hospital Management, Dr. Chidambra cleared her ADC Part 1 on her first attempt. In Australia, she has worked as a Practice Manager, Case Manager in Workers’ Compensation, Dental Assistant, and Receptionist — gaining a thorough understanding of the healthcare system, particularly in dentistry.
            </p>
            <p className="commitment-description">
              Having attempted the ADC Part 2 exam as well, she possesses strong conceptual knowledge and practical insights. Based in Australia, she recognised a gap in the ADC preparation offered by various institutions. This inspired her to mentor candidates who are either struggling or preparing for the exam for the first time.
            </p>
            <p className="commitment-description">
              She believes in making learning engaging and concept-driven, helping candidates not just pass the ADC exams by chance, but succeed through true understanding — paving the way to becoming confident, competent dentists in Australia and New Zealand.
            </p>
